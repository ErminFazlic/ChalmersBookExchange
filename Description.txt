Project Scope - Cello

Our project is to make a web application for buying and selling used course books for
chalmers students. Our aim is thus to create a centralized, streamlined experience for any
chalmers student looking to buy or sell a course book. Buyers will be able to search for books
via name, course code among other things and chat with the sellers.

Our hope is to work with Chalmers to create login via CID and possibly their bookstores to be
able to compare new and used book prices.

This will help reduce ecological waste while also being economical for the students.
