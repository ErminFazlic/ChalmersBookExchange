In this week we wwere almost done with everything, we had only some merging to do and prepare for the presentation and the final report. 
The presentation went very well, and we started with the final report.

On Monday we had a short meeeting discussing who want to work with the presentation and who prefer to do the report. Ermin decided to 
take the whole presentation because it would be too much for listeners if we switch between all of us during five minutes presentation.
The rest of us including me, started working on the final report and the weekly team reflection. The plan was to be done next week. 

We were confused in the beginning about how to start and what should be included, but after some searching in canvas course page 
we found what we needed. 

For my part I learned about pair programming this week, which was a technique we actually used during the whole project without us knowing 
it was a "denfined" technique. 

In general this course was very useful and interesting, also the project we decided to do made the course much funnier. 
For next week we will have to submit the final report and hope we get good grades.
