In this week, we had voted the idea for the projekt. 
The idea is a website where you can sell and buy course books for Chalmers' students.
We submitted the project scope in canvas as well.

The goal for next week is to create user stories, tasks and effort estimatiion. 
We will be doing this by learning how to write user stories from the lectures, 
and then discuss as much as possible with the team to chieve the best result
