In this week we were supposed to be done with three user stories but it didn't o as it was planned

The sprint started with as usual with a meeting with the supervisor in Monday, he was satisfied with 
the result. We had a meeting after with all the group memebers where we decided what should be done next week
and we divided the user stories to two groups. My group (me, Negin and Petra) joined the user sotry where a student
will be able to delete and edit posts belong to the student. We made a new branch for these user stories and 
pushed unfinished code to get some help. We worked over 20 hours to get it done but we faced a lot of complications in the code,
we knew that the code worked but we were missing something little. We asked for help from the othe group memebers but they didn't have time that week, 
we contacted our supervisor to get some help and we had a meeting with him but he also couldn't figure out the problem 
because tere were no comments in the whole project (we decided to fix it as soon as possible). 
Eventually the problem was solved Monday after that week with some help from group member. 

For my part I think despite all I learned a lot more about the project and specially th MVC model and how it works. I also 
learned how to manage to start with other user stories when I don't have any more ideas for this user story. 

For next week we will continue with the same user stories as ths week, Sven joined us too. We will try to not be stuck in the
same problems for days and try to find a way to solve it. For my part I want to learn how to debug the code to find the actuall 
problem and try to solve it, and I also want to learn how to google the right thing that I want to use because I think it's very important
to know what to google to find the right code.
