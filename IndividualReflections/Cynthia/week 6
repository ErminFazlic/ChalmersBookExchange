In this week we were suppoed to be done with the chat and delete & edit user stories, It went perfectly fine and we have even 
started with another user story "favorite posts"

The week started as usually with a meeting with the suoervisior, where we discussed how we should solve the problems we faced 
last week about not finding a solution for errors in the code and not getting help from others in the group. In the group 
meeting we had after the meeting with the supervisior, we suggested a solution for the problem which was an emergency meeting 
for emergency help or start with another user story until you get the help you need. 

Me, Petra, Negin and Sven continued to fix Delete and Edit user story, and it went great so we were finished with this task early 
in the sprint so we decided to start with the favorite user story. With help from Sven we were even done with this user story before
the sprint end. We didn't need any emergency meeting this week but it felt safe to have this option while working with the code. 
We started with the documentation of the code, and add it to definition of done which means that a user story will be defined as 
done if it's functioning and documented. 

For my part I watched some tutorials in youtube and google to get an idea about how to do favorite page, I also learned more about 
documenting code in C# aspnet core. 

For next week, we will be implementing the landing page and the user story where a student 
should be able to upload images as a post (if we have time) and also clean the repository in github. 
I will be watching more tutorials and attending in the lecture to know more about the presentation
