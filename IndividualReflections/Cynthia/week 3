We made some user stories in this week and added effort estimation for each one 
We had a meeting in Monday where we joined the Trello board for the team and wrote 
some user stories together and voted for EE for each task. For my part, I gave 
the team some ideas for tasks in each user story. I was little bit confused 
in the begining about how it works and what how many details should be 
included in the tasks. Other team members helped me understand it better by explaining 
how it should be done. I have even installed all the tools we will be using during the project 
like JetBrains and postgressql. I created a database with the tables we need in pgAdmin. I had 
some problems with the installation like forgetten password in postgres. As I learned from 
my mistakes in installation I helped other team members to get it done smoothly avoiding
my mistakes. 

The week otherwise went perfectly fine and the goal was achieved.
The goal for next weekis to begin coding starting with highest prriority user stories
like create post, browse posts and search for a specific post.

For next week task, I want to learn more about the new language "for me" C#, 
and start coding with it as well as HTML.
