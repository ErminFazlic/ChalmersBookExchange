We had a short meeting where everyone in the groupattended.
We haven’t decidedyet what we are going to do but we agreed about 
making sure that Scrum methodwill be followed during the whole project. 
I wantto learn from this course how to workin a team and how to plan for bigger 
projects in reallife.For our next meeting, everyone will present an ideafor the project.
