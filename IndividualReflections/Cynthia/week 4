In this week we are done with four user stories

In the meeting with the supervisor, he wanted us to add some task in some user stories 
and fix some missed EE in two user stories. We had a meeting exactly after the meeting 
with the supervisor where we fixed everything we had to and also divided the user 
stories between all the members. Me and three others fixed the search function so the users 
can search for a specific book by using book name or course code. It was a little bit 
challenging for us all to begin coding because it was new for the all four of us. 
We could fortunaly write the most of the code but after 6 hours of trying to connect
the search button with the new page we needed some help from other team members. 
With the help we got, we finally finished the task. The code has been tested and reviewed
from other member who were not part of writing this code.


The code for this task was written in my computer where I was screen sharing with 
rest of the group and getting help from them. I commited and pushed the code to github 
and made a pull request to review the code for other members I have even reviewed a code from the 
group in the team and merged their code to mine to get all the updates. 

For next week we will continue coding and divide other user stories to the team 
members. I think we will implement the post sorting and image post user sotries. 

I want to learn more about how to use data from the database, and frontend HTML
