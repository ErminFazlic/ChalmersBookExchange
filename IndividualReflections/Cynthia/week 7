The goals for this week was to be done with landing page, upload images user stories and also fix merging conflicts.
The goal was fully achieved without any problems.

We started the week with the short supervision meeting, the supervisor had not much to say except for excellent work to the team.
We had our weekly meeting right after that meeting where we dicussed the upcoming goal for the week and as usually divided 
the user stories between us. 

For my part I joined the landing page story together with Arian and Petra, we started implementing the page which should display
all posts and the user's favorite ones right beside each other in each box. For me it felt like just repeating unnecessary code
and making bad design, so I suggested that we implement the search field here and remove the Search page. We had a standup meeting 
with the whole group to get an approval for the suggestion, and fortunally everyone agreed. I copied the code from the search page 
to the landing page where I faced a problem with the routing, it couldn't find the getQueried page where we get when we hit the 
search button. After some researches I fixed the problem while Petra and Arian worked on design and CSS problems. 
I've learned this week much more about routing and css which I really wanted to learn about. 

For next week we will be continue fixing the design of the whole website focusing on Create Post page and merging to main. But 
in general we are almost done with the implementing part, and hopefully start to write the last report and doing the presentaton

The course in general was one of my funniest, most instructive and creative courses. I've learned much more than what I excepted and it 
gave me a fine pictures how real life programming look like.
