Individual Reflections week 3.

So for this week we worked on our Trello board, writing epics and userstories. Everyone came up with good ideas and it was fun 
discussing what would be a good userstory and suitable tasks for each one. After we had written down our 
userstories we then made an effort estimation by using planning poker. We seemed to have common view 
on the estimation for each story so that was good to see. Eventually the EE may be a bit off
but down the line we will gradually get better at it.

I got a ton of help from my team members to set up and installing everything on my computer, that was needed for the project.
There a lot of new things learn, for example data bases, html etc. that I need to look into more thorogly. 
I feel confident that my team members will help me achieve this task by helping me with new things I dont understand.

We will start with the base of our project next week, setting up the webpage and database then start writing code based on our
userstories. The current roles in our group will help us achieve each task efficiently and we will have a better
understanding of everyone's tasks.

Since I am new to almost everything, for this and forthcoming weeks I will have to dig into some tutorials on the web for the new coding
languages aswell as github that haven't used alot.
