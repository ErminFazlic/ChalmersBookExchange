Individual Reflections week 7

For this week we did the usually meeting of briefing the team of the completed tasks. 
Though we mainly use the trello board to get a good overview of the team's gathered effort, 
it suerly contributes to the team's spirit when discussing.
The chat function was completed which had good impact on the value of our project. 
The user story for the add favorites-features was also completed.
Ermin informed us that he did some clean up in the code, bevause he had very good
overview of our project. Some of us did the same for the methods that we hade created in the project.
We had also commented the code as we saw it fit as an criteria in our updated DoD.

The user story for todays sprint was distributed among the team members, the landing page and
the ability to upload images to the post was planned to be completed this sprint.

Negin and me took on the upload user story and planned a meeting on tuesday to work on the code.
We had both whatched some tutorials on how to complete the task, though we ran into some problems
regarding the functionality that would cause fragility in our code base. Regarding the 
agile aspect of it, we could in a resonable amount of time deliver the expected functionality,
though it would cause us some technical dept. This was a nice experience in how we discuss
the different outcomes and how it could give value to the project. 
We stated that, we should try a pretty basic approach on the problem so as we could
deliver some functionality though we would gather more information about the topic along the sprint.

On our meeting on thursday we discussed about the final presenation and how we would devide the
tasks among the group. Some would do work on the presentation and some would work on the 
final team report. We would later looked on the final work together to see if anyone 
would like to add something.
The other thing we discussed was that we ran into some problems regarding the merge of the
branches for the chat function and the favorite funcion. Ermin briefed us on what different functionality 
of the website that didn't work anymore. To start debugging, the team members responsible for their
respective user story group up in order to effectively find the source of the bug. 

After the meeting, the girls and I assembled to find out the bug. We manage eventually to find the source 
of the problem; it was cause by a collision in the code when the chat function was implemented. 
We would later have to inform the rest of the team in order to fix this as best as possible with
the agile apect of it. This because we want to deliver as much value to the customer as possible.

Later this Sunday, Negin and I manage to finish the code for making users be able to upload images
to their posts. What remains to be done is to write the documentation of the code.

For next week, starting monday, Negin and I will finsih the documentation after our scheduled meeting. 
Further more the team will start working on some improvement of the code to make it more manageble. Later
on we will start looking on the final representtion and what is needed to be done. For my part I
will try to contribute as much as possbile to my team with suggestions and ideas I have gathered along this
weeks sprint that will help us make a good delivery for our final reprentation.
