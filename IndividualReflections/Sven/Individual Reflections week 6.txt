Individual Reflections week 6.

At the start of this week's meeting, we briefed about the last weeks progress. In contrast to the other weeks
we did encounter some problems among the tasks that some of the team members had. Some userstories were not finished
at the end of the sprint, so we had to come up with some ideas among the team to prevent further similiar 
problems in our projects. We agreed on a very simple yet quite effective way, which was to have so called
emergency meetings. Thanks to the already existing and eminent communication in our group, the execution for this
way of approaching the problem, was easily done. It would help the ease the mind of our team members in further 
developing our project.
Another way of dealing with the previously mentioned problem was to change the user story, that was currently in progress, 
to another one.This would in term help the team to not get stuck with the development and switch focus to another task in order to
progress in the project. This would of course have to be in line with the current user story, actually could be 
delayed and not prohibiting further development. Yet again, an emergency meeting would likely intercept possible
problems that would had to be taken care of first, in order to switch user stories. 
This could be boiled down to updating and chaing our social contract.

The user stories that I assigned myself up to was the stories that had not yet been completed. With some collective knowledge
from tutorials that I took previous week, I believed to have some of the tools needed in order to resolve the problems that my 
other team members had encountered. During the week we manage to finish the edit and delete function together and I shared 
some of my knowledge from the prevoius tutorials how to solve similar problems. This a effective way inhow to contribute
noth to my team and my teamâ€™s deliveries.

With this completed user stories the team started to comment our code as we saw it as the next necessary step. (This could
be an updating criteria in our DoD that the code need to be completely and correctly commented.)
Me and my team planned to further take us on a new user story since we were able to finish the previous task  pretty quickly. 
The user story was to be able to add favorite post to the user, and planned to work on the code on thursday after the usually
scheduled meeting on thursdays.

So the situation right now were I want to be is to be able to finish this user story before the end of this week's sprint. 
To get there is to use the same approach as last time, watching tutorials and test out some ideas in the code. This while 
simultaneously sharing my current progress, interacting and code together with my team members in order to complete the task at hand.  
Would an exigency occur, we now have better tools to handle it.
