Individual Reflections week 5.

For this week we started our meeting by sharing different experiences of the week before. We all had 
something important to share as well as new ideas and thoughts about the project. Thus we made some changes
to the different user stories as we saw a more suitable approach some of the tasks/stories. We had everyone agree on the 
changes and started to distribute us among the new tasks. Some of choose different collaborators among the team
which I thought as good learning opportunity for each and everyone, to get learn new experience from other members.

Before I started on my tasks I had still some tutorials some take on since I still hade much to
learn so I could tarted coding. I found the microsoft documents particulary interesting for my choice 
of new knowlede, on the internet. Thought it had me spend a lot of hours of actually making "new" 
projects similar to what we already was achiving, it gave me some tools to work with in the future of our
project. 
We booked meetings where we asimilated to help each other with the code. We found some good information online
where we could interpret it in our project, thought it was a challenge to actually intergrate in our code structure.
The next day we got help from Ermin to set us on the right path to finish what we had started. He left me some
TODO lines which I finished working on and the tasks finally became completed! 

For the next week I will continue to try expanding my knowledge in ASP Net core, as I previusly mentioned, the documentation
from the microsoft site seemed very legit and comprehensive. There still a lot of youtube videos out there that
I need to checkout. At the same time, I will try to understand Git a bit better as seems to be a vital tool 
for every projectgroup.
