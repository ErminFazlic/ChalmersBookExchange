Individual Reflections week 5.

For this week we started our meeting by sharing different experiences of the week before. We all had
something important to share as well as new ideas and thoughts about the project. Thus we made some changes
to the different user stories as we saw a more suitable approach for some of the tasks/stories. We had everyone agree on the
changes and started to distribute us among the new tasks. Some of choose different collaborators among the team
which I thought was a good learning opportunity for each and everyone, to learn new experiences from other members.

Before I started on my tasks I had still some tutorials to take on since I still had much to
learn before I could really start coding. I found the microsoft documents particularly interesting for my choice
of new knowledge. Thought it had me spend a lot of hours of actually making "new"
projects similar to what we already was achieving, it gave me some tools to work with in the future of our
project.
We booked meetings where we assimilated to help each other with the code. We found some good information online
where we could interpret it in our project, though it proved to be a challenge to actually integrate it in our code structure.
The next day we got help from Ermin to set us on the right path to finish what we had started. He left me some
TODO lines which I finished working on and the tasks finally were completed!

For the next week I will continue to expanding my knowledge in ASP Net core, as I previously mentioned, the documentation
from the microsoft site seemed very legit and comprehensive. There still a lot of youtube videos out there that
I need to check out. At the same time, I will try to understand Git a bit better as seems to be a vital tool
for every project group.
