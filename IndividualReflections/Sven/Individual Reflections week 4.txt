Individual Reflections week 4.

This week we assigned the different user stories among the members. We stared coding on our project and along the
way we help each other finishing our tasks. It was wondeful to know that we had such a helping approach to each other
since I am new to alot of things and Im afraid that will be a burden to my team.

We booked some meetings on Zoom where we met up and help each other to finish our tasks and move the
different cards on our trello board accordingly.
Next week will continue working on our user stories from the trello board and discuss 
our experience of our sprint, maybe make some adjusments to our EE as we get better 
on our agile experience.

As for me, I will try to get more comfortable at coding in c# and html to able to work more
independently. There will be alot of hours infront youtube tutorials and googling aswell as playing
aroung in the project.
