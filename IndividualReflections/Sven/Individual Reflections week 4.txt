Individual Reflections week 4.

This week we assigned different user stories among the members. We started coding on our project 
and along the way we helped each other finish our tasks. It was wonderful to know that we had such a helping approach to each other
since I am new to a lot of things and I was a bit afraid that it would be a burden to my team.

We booked some meetings on Zoom where we met up and help each other to finish our tasks and move the
different cards on our trello board accordingly.
Next week will continue working on our user stories from the trello board and discuss
our experience of our sprint, maybe make some adjustments to our EE as we get better
on our agile experience.

As for me, I will try to get more comfortable at coding in C# and HTML to able to work more
independently, maybe testing something that could improve the webpage. There will be a lot of hours 
in front of youtube tutorials and googling as well as “playing” around in the project.
