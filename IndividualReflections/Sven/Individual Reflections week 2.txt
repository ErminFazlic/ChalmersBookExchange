Individual Reflections week 2.

Now for the second week we discussed different topics for what we could develop as a team. 
Since I didn’t have any particular suggestion myself I was very open and curious about
what the other team members had come up with. We decided to make a webpage for students to 
sell their second-hand school literature as well as buying books too.

As for now I need to learn more about web application and coding in C# since that's what we agreed 
upon using regarding our project. I will try to search for information, videos regarding the topic, 
in hope to learn more about the tools. This in regards to a technical aspect, 
won't be an issue or bottleneck further work. I will also have my team members to turn to if there
is something that I need help with. If I can get to the point where I have a sustainable workflow,
I will try my best to help my fellow members too, not just in technical stuff but also in things 
that will contribute to our project, might it be planning, structure etc.


Since we haven’t really begun using scrum to the fullest, I have yet not anything particular in terms 
of agile project management that I can use to contribute to my team, other than what I mentioned above.
