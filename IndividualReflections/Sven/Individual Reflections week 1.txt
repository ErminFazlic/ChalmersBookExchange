Individual Reflections week 1.

For the first week I feel that it could be a good asset to learn about databases. 
The upcoming project seems to aim for that kind of software that requires me to 
understand at least the basic concepts of it. In the end, I want to feel comfortable 
when using it, thus making me an asset to my team. 
Next thing I want to learn more about is scrum and feel comfortable with it, 
though it will eventually come naturally the more we do exercises and work with our project.

A good way of helping my team will be to share newly learned knowledge of Scrum 
and other agile-related topics, along the way as the course continues. 
To be open with new ideas and discuss topics that relate to our team and project, 
will connect and strengthen ourselves as a team based group.

As we haven’t started our project yet, we haven’t assigned any specific 
roles to our team members. Therefore it is hard to tell what my contribution 
with Scrum would be. The only thing I could think of is to follow the values of what 
Scrum intends to describe, be vigilant, open for new ideas and directions, 
have a good connection with the team and so on.

I'm hopeful that I will discover some of my strengths that will 
help me contribute to my team and its deliveries. I’m also hopeful that 
I will discover some of my weaker sides that I need to work on, to 
further improve myself, thus making me a better asset to my team.
