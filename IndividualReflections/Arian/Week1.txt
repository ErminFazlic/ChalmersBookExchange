Individual reflection for week 1

On the first week we just assembled the team and starting learning about each other. In addition to that, 
we discussed the level of knowledge and experience among the group members regarding doing a whole project.  
Furthermore, we discussed what kind of project we want to work on and brainstormed.
 
My learning objective will be to deepen my knowledge regarding the agile concept and learn how to work in 
this manner so I can contribute in an efficient manner. In order to do this, I need to learn more about the 
Scrum framework because we will be using it in this course. It will be a great opportunity for me to learn 
about this because all the big tech companies seem to use this framework to build something of value and 
solve complex problems as a team. Therefore, it seems like a good idea to have this in my arsenal as a developer.
