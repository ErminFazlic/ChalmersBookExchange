Individual reflection for week 2

For this week we kept discussing what kind of project we want to do. I suggested to make a website 
for Chalmers students where they can sell their used books to other Chalmers students. The majority 
of the group members seemed to like this idea, therefore we chose this and started discussing how the 
page would look like and what kind of functionality we want this page to have. I used photoshop to make 
some quick mockups so we can have a visual idea of how we want the end product to look like. We decided 
as a group that we want to this project in C# and use asp.net as a framework. Our objective as a group will
be to create a Trello board and fill it with userstories.
 
In order for me to a be a valuable asset to my team I need to learn more about C# and asp.net and this 
will be my learning objective for the week. My method to reach this goal will be to watch YouTube tutorials, 
read on online ressources avaliable and try to code a little bit on my own.
