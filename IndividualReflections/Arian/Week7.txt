individual reflection week 6
This week we managed to finish our user stories as a group. 
I managed to reach the individual KPI of minimum of 2 hours. Me and my group member worked on the landing page. At first we were suposed to make
the landing page in a way that shows the recent postings and the user's favorites. However we felt it's redundant and told the group about it.
We decied to have a standup meeting to discuss this and after the meeting we decided to move the search functionality to the landing page. 
We impelemnted this and when we showed this to the group they liked it very much. We managed to get this user story done through pair programming in zoom. 

As meantioned in the team reflection we are done with our website, there are some styling concerns about some pages, which we will be focusing on during
this week but otherwise the website is fully functioning as intended.
