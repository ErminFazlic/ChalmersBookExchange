individual reflection week 6
This week we managed to finish our user stories as a group. 
I managed to reach the individual KPI of minimum of 2 hours. Me and my group member worked on the chat functionality. 
We managed to get this user story done through pair programming. We as a group managed to do 2 user story as well which is what was agreed upon. 

For the next week we want to get the remaining user stories done as well as cleaning the repository.

My leaning objective for this week will be to try to work individually on a single user story .
