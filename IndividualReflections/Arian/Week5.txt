Individual reflection week 5

This week we did the same thing as the last week, we split up our team in two different groups and each group picked a user story to work 
on so we can reach our KPI of 2 user stories per sprint more efficiently. 
I pair programmed with two other team members and reached the KPI of minimum of 2 hours worked. We managed to get our user story done, 
however the other group got stuck on an error and were unable to finish their user story in time. We tried helping them but there was not 
enough time to fix the issue. We discussed this later with the TA on our supervision meeting and he suggested that we should discuss this 
later in our group meeting and come up with potential solutions in order to avoid this happening again in the future. We did as the TA 
suggested and our solution to this problem was to: 
1. Start on another user story if you are stuck and you can not get any help from other team members. 
2. Have an emergency meeting at the end of the week if the problem is not fixed.  
The TA also suggested that we should do a better job of documenting the code in order for the code being easier to understand if somebody 
else wants to jump in and help. He was suggesting that maybe we should update our Definition of Done. 

For next week we want to finish the user story that we didnâ€™t manage to get done as well as implementing the chat functionality. 
We also want to comment our code and provide better documentation for better code readability. 

My learning objective for next week will be to learn how to deal with such events in future, as well as better time manegment.
