Individual reflection for week 3

For this week we worked on our Trello board and wrote some epics and user stories. After we 
were satisfied with our Trello board, we used the effort poker for the different user stories 
in order to estimate the level of difficulty on each user story. After that we ranked each 
user story based on the functionality priority, meaning what user story is the most important 
for this website being able to be useful with the top ones, like being able to create an 
account, being the most important and so on.

I got some help from my team members to set up and install the basics for the projects in 
order to get started with the project. We decided to use Rider as IDE and use PostgreSQL for 
our database management. 

Our objective for next week will be to setup the page and connect it to the database so we 
something to work on. 

My focus this week will be to keep learning about C#, ASP.Net as well as learning to use 
GitHub and learning more about  branches, commit, push and pull requests.
