Individual reflection week 4

This week we split our team in 2 subgroups and each team chose a user story. Me and another team member 
chose the user story regarding being able to upload posts. We pair programmed through screen sharing and 
doing different parts of the user story as much as possible to finish this assignment in time and we were 
successful in that. I managed to reach the KPI of minimum of 2 hours per week as well as the team being 
able to reach the KPI of finishing 2 user stories per sprint. 

We would like to keep this going as a team and keep doing the user stories. 
My learning objective for next week is getting better at coding, working more efficiently in pair and independently. For this to happen I am going to use google and search for relevant resources.
