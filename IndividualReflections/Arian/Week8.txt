individual reflection week 8

Nothing has happened much during this week. We were mainly focused on the presentation of our project and the final report.
We split up the work, Ermin was responsible for the video and group presentation and the rest of the group focused on
the final report. We were satisfied with the group presentation, Ermin did a very good job.
The rest of the group managed to get the report done as well and everyone seemed to be satisfied. 

I found the report a bit challenging, specially in the begining since there were no clear guidlines on how to write it. 
Because of this we spent a lot of time discussing on how to structure the final report and this weas done mainly 
through zoom. 

An example report would be helpfull, maybe this is something 
that the teachers can keep in mind for the next time.
