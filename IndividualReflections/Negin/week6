This week we continued with delete and edit user story which we did not have time to finish it during last week. 
Sven joinded us and we worked on the rest of the code together.
We finished it and started with the favorite user story and got quite farin it. the other ones were done with the chat function 
and we will check their code and test it then we will approve it in github.

We did't have the same situation as last week, which is very positive because our solutions seem to fit our group correctly and work for us. 
Everyone was available and worked on the project, which led to that we all are finished what we planned. 
for my part was very studying on youtube and google to be able to figure out the favorite function which was positive. I learned a lot of new things. 

we changed our definition of done(DOD). We decided that all code must be documented before it is counted as done. Therefore, we sat a lot during the week and 
fixed documentation for our code, which was very educational.

For the next week we will fix the landing page, we will try to fix that the students will be able to upload images on their posts
and at last we will clean the repository in github wich was a suggestion from Pontus under supervision appointment. we had many questions about
presentation wich we will be able to ask on tuesday under the lectur and then we will start planning for it.
