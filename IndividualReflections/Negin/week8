This week we had our last supervision meeting with Pontus. He said that our project looked good and we managed everything we planned except some small problems
and changes that we made during the process. Finally, both we as a group and Potus were satisfied with the result and all the functionality and design of the website.

We had the presentation on Wednesday, which we all agreed that one of us will fix the presentation and record it in a video so we can show it when it's our turn, we
check the presentation and approved it before presentation day. Ermin fixed presentation very well and professionally. Showed a bit of the base design, the database 
and the whole website and all the functionality in it. The presentation went really well and we answered the teachers' questions afterwards and got a good response 
to the presentation and the result of our work. During the week we tried to continue clean up Github and our files that need to be submitted and started planning for 
the final report. The group felt that the explation for the report was a bit unclear so we tried to figure out how the structure of the report should be and then we 
decided how we want to write it together and all the details regarding the report. We started writing a little on it together and then we wrote a little bit individually
during the week.

For the next week and unfortunately last week, we want to finish writing the report and fix everything that is needed to be submitted and be done on time. 
We will sit with the final report a few days during next week and finish it. And then we are done :)

Communication, atmospher and feelings in our group is in top as it was during the project. So grateful and satisfied!
