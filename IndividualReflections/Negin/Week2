This week we chose the topic for the project and some details about this.


For next week we will do epics and user stories which we all need to work on during this week and learn from the lectures. We will hopefully 
start with Trello board and get started. we have not talked much about the programming itself yet. we will fix the base of the project first and then
divide the work and get started.

The team are helping each other during the week and explains different relative concepts in case someone has not understood properly.
