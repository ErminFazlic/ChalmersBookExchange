This week we wrote tasks for each user story in our trello board and supplemented the table. 
Then we shared some user stories between us and started working on them and programming. 
It went really well, the use of Github and JeBrains Rider is new to most of us in the group so in the beginning 
it will require a lot of time and help from google and other ones in the group who can this apps better but 
later we will surely land in and understand it better. 

We who would take care of the same user story booked a few meetings together and wrote the code with the help of each other 
which was very educative and effective, finally we took help from Ermin who knows more about this apps and solved 
the last part of the code which was complicated. 

for my part I will try to learn much more about the apps we use to be able to solve most problems independently and feel more 
comfortable to working with these apps. For next week, we will continue in the same way, split up user stories between us and start programming.
