My reflection of the first week's meeting has been positive. We all participated in the discussions, everyone had different ideas and thoughts,
which made the meeting effective. Everyone tried to find the best solution to our problems and do a good teamwork together. 
Because we all have different schedules, we had to choose one day a week for our meeting and then over time we will see if we need to have more meetings during the week or not.
Everyone tried to find the best day that suits everyone. Next week we decide on our project topic and start planning. 
We should all present an idea that would suit our project and finally we choose the one that everyone likes. That everyone participates in the work helps us to be more creative 
and make fewer mistakes.

For my part, I try to find a good topic for our project and think a little about the planning. Must be prepared if anyone has any questions regarding my idea to be able 
to answer in a good way. Everyone will get a better picture of my thought and we can discuss it better together. On the other hand, I will listen to otherâ€™s ideas 
carefully and try to understand their thoughts and be active. In this way we can develop each other's ideas and find the right topic for our project. 
We listen to all lessons, so we can help each other if someone has missed something or has not understood it properly. We all try to make a good collaboration together. 
I am very happy with my group and we will do our best to do a good project together.
