This week we did the best we could on the Trello board and found our epics and user stories. We discussed in the group and agreed very quickly. 
So far, it is very easy to work with the group, everyone is helpful and good and trying to do what they can and know.

We used the effort poker for each epic and ranked them. We made an estimation effort without having tasks, but still everyone's opinions about each epic were
close to each other which made i much easier. 

for next week we will start with our database, main page and write tasks for each epic and then start programming and sharing the work between us. 
We will have a few rolls in our group which makes the meetings easier. Better teamwork when everyone knows what to do and has clear instructions.

For my part I should learn about the launguage we use for our project and installation of the apps we will use during the process. Learn more about
github and other things we must have and be able to do before we start programming. will certainly take help from others in the group who know a lot 
more about this and try to do my best.
