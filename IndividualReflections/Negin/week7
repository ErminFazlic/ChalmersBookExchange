This week we tried to get all the code we had together and get a working code with all the functions we had implemented. 
We divided us into smaller groups and each group took a new user story plus had to clear the code and make it easier to read. 

Got some problems during the process but in the end we solved it together. Sven and I had a user story that would fix the upload image function on the website. 
We worked and read about it individually then we took some meetings during the sprint and fixed a working code that gave the opportunity to the user to be able to 
upload an image and delete the image. this part was very interesting and educational, we have pushed the code to the github but it is still not really finished 
because we have not written the documentation for our code which according to our DOD is not Done yet.
We have started planning for the presentation and the final report, started to share the work and fix important parts of the project for the final submission.
The cooperation in the group and the communication was excellent this week, everyone was available as soon as someone had asked something and tried to help 
eachother and in that way the group had efficient working hours. 

For the next week We will write the documentation during tomorrow's meeting and move to the Done column in the trello table. We will take a closer look at the planning 
of the final report and presentation and start working on them. Will certainly work on the code and make it easier to read and fix the last small details that
we wish the website would be able to handle. for my part, I will do my best to finish what I need to finish and help others in the group to ge the best results and
of course learn a lot more about the structure of the final report and what is needed for the presentation.
