this week me and two others in the group worked with the delete and edit function in the project. 
We stuck to a problem and tried to solve it in all possible ways for three days but it did not work,
then we tried to get help from the other ones in the group but due to lack of time they could help us and 
those who had time could not find the error in the code. After that we contacted Pontus, teacher assistance, 
but we could not solve the problem. 

we put in a lot of time which was very inefficient and still resulted in nothing. we left the project aside and 
waited until the next meeting to be able to get help and solve it. It was a struggling week with a lot of time wasted.
for my part, I have to get better at solving situations like this and not waste hours on one and the same problem. 
should find a good solution to this and give it as a suggestion to the group. 

for the next week we will come up with solutions regarding to this kind of situations to avoid wasting time and increase 
efficient days during the work time. For next week we will first solve our problem with the user story that we had since last week
and then we can continue and take a new user story and start working on it. the boys in the  group worked on one and the same user story,
which is finished and merged. They will surely start with a new user story but before that we will all try together to solve the error
in our code and rhen move on.
