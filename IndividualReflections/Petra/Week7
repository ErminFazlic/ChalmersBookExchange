This week we started to round off the project. We merged the different branches and some merging conflicts occurred, 
but we solved it. Although it causes some problem with the delete/edit and the chat function, but we made it work in the end. 
We also started to do more CSS so that the website would have a look and cleaned our repository in github. 

We divided us into two smaller groups this week too since this is a good way for us to work, also to reach our KPI of minimum 
2 hours. Me and my group choose to work with the landing page and to do some CSS. The user story that was written in our trello 
was to have recent posts and favorite post on the landing page. After we have implemented these, we discovered that the landing 
page were a repeated side of two other pages. Therefore, me and my group decided to have a meeting in the middle of the week to 
discuss this with the other team members. Everyone agreed with us, so we decided to remove the search page and have the search 
function on the landing page. As usual we do pair programming, but we always ends up writing the code on one computer to make it 
easier when we push the code on github etc. 

Next week we donâ€™t have too much to do since the website and its functionality are done. We will do some more CSS to make the website 
to look more like a book exchange for Chalmers and make some fix here and there. Finally, we will merge everything. 

Our goal for the next week is to start with the final report and the presentation. Also, to fix some little details to fit into our 
Definition of Done. For my learning part, since we are almost done there is nothing to learn more about otherwise than the structure 
for the report etc.
