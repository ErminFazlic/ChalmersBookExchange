This week we had our presentation of our project. In the beginning of the week, we had our last supervision 
with our supervisor Pontus. We showed him our final website and we were all proud of the result. The presentation 
also went well. We decided in the last sprint that only one in the team, Ermin, would prerecord a presentation and 
then show it while the others will work on the final report. However, everyone watched the video before the presentation 
to approve that everything was included. 

We started writing on our final report this week. Since we didn’t find a strict structure of the report, we discussed and 
planned our structure so that it would be easier to write. After finding a structure we started writing together while we 
were on zoom. 

For the next week, which also is the last week, we will focus on writing the last parts of the final report and clean the 
repository. We will have some zoom meetings during the week and finish it. Since it is the last week, we don’t have something 
new to learn more than to reflect on the whole learning process and write about in the report. It has been fun these weeks
and I have learned a lot. Also, my group have been very supported during the whole project and helped each other.
