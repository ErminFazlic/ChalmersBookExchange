This week we started to work with the user story that we couldn’t finish the last sprint. We finished it 
with the help of the rest of the team member on our sprint meeting that we have in the beginning of every 
sprint. Then we commented the code to make it easier to understand what every method does. I think that 
this a good way to understand the code for someone who wasn’t involved in writing that piece of code and 
a good learning objective. On the meeting we also discussed and reflected on how the last sprint went and 
how we could do in the coming sprints so that the problem that occurred in the previous sprint don’t happened 
again. We discussed about our KPI, that everyone should at least sit with the project at minimum 2 hours. Also, 
that if some group doesn’t finish their user story at get stuck, we will have an “emergency meeting” so we can 
finish the user story before the end of the sprint. Another solution was to start with another user story if 
someone got stuck which I personally don’t think is an effective way because maybe one user story is based on 
the other. If the user stories aren’t related, this solution is a good way to avoid spending inefficiency time. 

Since we finished with the last sprint’s user story quickly, we started with another user story and almost completed 
it before the end of this sprint. This week went well, we had no complications. All the team members participated and 
helped each other. 

Our goal for the next week is to make the last user stories and clean our repository since everything must be done in 
about two weeks. We will continue to divide us into smaller groups and work that way since it works well for us and for 
the development of the project. For my part, I will continue to learn more about the MVC in ASP net core. Since we’re 
almost done, there isn’t that much new things to learn but more to delve into the things I have learned during the project 
to help the improve of the team’s performance.
