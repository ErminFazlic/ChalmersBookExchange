This week we started to find different project ideas. Then we discussed and decided on which 
idea we want to continue with and with what language we want to work with. 
We wrote down a project scope.

Our plan for the next week is to write down several user stories with their tasks and effort estimation. 
Also, to find epics that are relevant.
To prepare myself, I have searched on google and on the lectures about user stories and epics.
