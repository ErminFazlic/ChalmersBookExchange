This week we continued to code some new user stories. We worked in the same way as we did last week, 
meaning that we split into two smaller groups where you choose which user stories you wanted to work 
with and created groups based on that. As a said in the last reflection, I think that this way to work 
is good because it is easier to follow the process and it is a great opportunity to help and learn from 
each other. And in the end of the sprint, we discuss as a whole team about the groups’ user stories and 
merge the code.

For my part, this week’s user stories were a little more challenging than the week before. Me and my group 
sat for several hours trying to make the code to work. After many hours, we asked the group for help but 
since everyone were busy, we contacted our supervisor Pontus to get some help. We also took a meeting with 
one of our team member Sven that showed me and my group some suggestions that we could look at and that maybe 
could help us. The sum of this week is that we couldn’t complete the whole user story since we got some error. 
But at least we finished a bit and we probably just missed something small that we could not come up with. I 
hope that we can fix it with the whole team in the beginning of next sprint so that we can continue with new 
user stories.

Our goal for the next week is to keep coding our user stories and keep working in smaller groups depending on 
which user story everyone wants to work with. For my part, I will continue to learn more about ASP net core 
although I have learned quite a lot the last weeks. That means more hours on google reading and watching tutorials 
on how to work with the MCV model in ASP net core and c#.
