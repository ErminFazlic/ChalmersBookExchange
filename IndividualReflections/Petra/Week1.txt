My reflection over the first week is that it went well. We had a nice meeting in the beginning of week 1 and discussed about what type of 
project we want to do and how our schedule is so that we can have at least one meeting a week.

The current situation is to find a topic for our project. On our first meeting, we decided that everyone should think about a topic over 
the week so that on the next meeting we will discuss the different topics and decide together which one is interesting. 
I think that by talking, listening, and discussing it would be easier to help the team and learn something new.

I want to learn how to work in an agile team and the methods to make it work with a bigger team.
