This week we started to discuss user stories and epics. By setting up a trello board, 
we made it easier for everyone to write down every user story and epic they could think of.
After that we prioritized the user stories and epics. We wrote down tasks to each user story 
and made effort estimations with the help of effort poker. 

Everyone attended which made the meeting efficient and good. We also tried to assign roles
in the group such as Scrum Master and Product Owner as long as minor roles such as secretary, 
someone who will handle all the meetings etc. 

For the next week we will start coding some user stories. So, for my part, I will learn more 
about the language we will use, the program and simulations and GitHub to facilitate the work.
