This week we started to code some user stories. We started with the user stories that are highest prioritized. 
To make it easier, we divided us into two smaller groups and started working together on zoom. That made it easier
if we had any questions or wanted to discuss something. For my part it was effective to work on zoom in smaller group 
since this type of project is new for me. 

Then when we felt that we were done, we took a meeting with our Scrum Master Ermin, 
to finish the last part that we couldn’t code since he has a little more understanding of this. 
When the group felt that they were completely done, 
one in the smaller group made a pull request in GitHub so that the team members could review the code. 

Our goal for the next week is to keep coding our user stories. Since it worked well to work in smaller groups, 
I hope and think that we will keep working this way. For my part, I must keep searching and have a better 
understanding of how to code with C# and HTML. 

But overall, it’s going well for me, and the teamwork is going well.
