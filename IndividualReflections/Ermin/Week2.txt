For this week we had decided on a project and what languages to use for it aswell as a project
scope. Not much more however.

For the next week we want to create a trello board and fill it with Epics and User Stories.
That is our main goal. We will only start with the project if we feel we've done the above
sufficiently.

For this to be achieved my current learning objective is learning more about user stories and
epics through the lectures aswell as online resources. Aswell as sharing this and discussing
the topics with the team.
