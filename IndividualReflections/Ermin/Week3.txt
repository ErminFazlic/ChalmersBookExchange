For this week we wanted to do some user stories and epics.

I contributed towards reaching this goal by acting as Scrum leader, helping the team set up
the trello board and also leading the effort poker for the different user stories we came up
with. In addition to this I also came up with some of the user stories and ranked the
priority for them.

For the next week we want to setup the page and connect a database to it, a "skeleton package"
or something like that. Since I have the most experience in this I will do it while walking
through the steps with my team to help them understand the process.

For my learning objective next week is to learn more about the role of Scrum leader since I
felt a little bit lost on what to do and how to lead the meeting. This will further help to
deliver our goals for each sprint since a better structure and more clear instructions should
lead to better teamwork.
