Not much to say here since it was the first week and we just said we would bring some ideas
for projects for the next week.

My main learning objective is to further understand the agile process and learn to use it to
our group's advantage. My reasoning for this is, when looking at job postings for software
developers, a lot of them either require or prefer experience in working with the agile
process. This shows that it is the current paradigm and therefore a valuable asset to any 
software developer.
