For this week we wanted to finish our user stories that we set up for this sprint.

I contributed towards this goal by reaching the individual KPI of 2 hours worked and also
helping the others when needed if the time was available. I did pair programming this week
aswell with one of the team members to finish. By doing this we managed to finish the user
story to be able to sort posts. We however did not complete the team KPI of 2 user stories per
sprint. Since the other group got stuck on an issue and we did not have enough time to help
them.

For the next week we want to keep doing user stories. We've decided on finishing the user
stories the other group did not have time to finish aswell as implementing the chat functionality
for the next sprint.

For my learning objective next week is to try and learn more about different approaches to 
solving these kinds of issues that can arise when one part of the team gets stuck. This will
hopefully make sure we don't get in those situations where a lot of man-hours are wasted.
