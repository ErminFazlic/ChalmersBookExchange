For this week we wanted to finisih our user stories that we set up for this sprint and we 
finished the base for the project.

I contributed towards reaching this goal by, again, acting as the scrum leader. That included 
leading the scrum meetings and managing the board. I did pair programming with one of the team
members to finish our assigned user story and helping the other team members with their user
stories if they got stuck. This meant that I reached the individual KPI of 2+ hours worked per
week aswell as us as a team reaching our team KPI of finishing 2 user stories per sprint.

For the next week we want to keep doing user stories, moving up to down on our sprint backlog.
We've decided on doing sorting criterias for the search and the function of deleting and editing
posts made by a user.

For my learning objective next week is to learn more about the concept of pair programming
and how to make it more efficient. To do this I will use online resources. This will hopefully
allow us to work more efficiently since we've worked in pairs for the most part.
