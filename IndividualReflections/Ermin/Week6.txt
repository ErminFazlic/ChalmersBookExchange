For this week we wanted to finish our user stories that we set up for this sprint.

I contributed towards this goal by reaching the individual KPI of 2 hours worked. Me and my
group member worked on the chat functionality using pair programming this week aswell. Where 
we sit together and one person writes code and the other helps and then rotate those roles
periodically. We also managed to reach the team KPI of 2 user stories done so it was a good
sprint.

For the next week we want to do the finishing user stories aswell as cleaning up the repository
and code. These user stories are making a landing page after logging in and the ability to 
save posts as favorites for logged in users.

I don't have a specific learning objective for next week since it, at this moment, is not
entirely clear to me what I can focus on learning to help improve the team's performance.
For this reason I will keep an open mind to changing the learning objective.
