For this week we wanted to finish ou user stories that we set up for this sprint.

I contributed towards this goal by reaching the individual KPI of 2 hours worked. I fixed some
merging issues and cleaned up the repository aswell as adding a readme file. In addition to
this I also did some styling for buttons and made it be the same throughout the project for
visual consistency.

For the next week we want to merge the final branches together and maybe fix some styling
depending on what we agree on.

Since we are pretty much finished with the project I don't haver any specific learning
objectives.
